# CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science

This is a repository for Harvard's CS50x course projects.

These are my solutions to the problem sets and they can be run locally. Some may contain web applications and need more than the terminal input of "python app_name.py" to run.

In this case to run a Python web application locally, navigate to your project directory in the terminal, then execute the command python app.py (where "app.py" is the name of your Python file containing the web application logic), which will start a local server; you can then access your application in a web browser by going to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port number in your code).




# About The Course:

### What is CS50x?

CS50x is an online adaptation of Harvard University's well-known introductory computer science course, CS50. Designed to cater to learners of all experience levels, CS50x introduces the fundamental concepts of computer science and programming. Participants explore algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and web development. The course incorporates multiple programming languages, such as C, Python, and JavaScript, emphasizing practical, hands-on learning through a variety of projects and problem sets. By completing CS50x, learners gain a robust foundation in computer science and acquire the skills necessary to address real-world programming challenges.
